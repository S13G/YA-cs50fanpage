<h2>Project Description<br><hr>
  My Final Project is 'CS50 Fan Page'. It is a simple website which i made for students of cs50 to appreciate the beauty of the course and its instructors.
The inspiration for this project was personal. I was literally confused and didnt know so many things but CS50 adressed these and now i can say for sure I know the fundamentals. CS50 didnt just teach me programming languages, it taught me how to learn any programming language and tools i need making me versatile!

<h2>
The website has 4 pages:<br>
1. Landing Page<br>
2. Fan Gallery page<br>
3. Comments<br>
4. CS50 Wall<br>
</h2>
<h3>
The Landing page introduces CS50 and allow users to type in "I took CS50" to be counted as part of the alumni.<br>
The Fan Gallery shows cool pictures of instructors and othe cool stuff.<br>
Visitors can post comments in the comments page.<br>
On the CSWall page, users can post their name on the Wall. The wall is a big board containing nicknames of those who had taken the course. This feature was quite challenging for me but I was able to learn a bit of ajax and fetch apis to interface with django.
